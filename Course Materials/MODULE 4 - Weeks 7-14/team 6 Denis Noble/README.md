# Bayesian and Discriminant Analysis ðŸ“‰ðŸ§¬

## Team 6 - Dennis Noble

**Members:**
- Amanda Adams
- Grace Tugado
- Elizabeth Esquivel
- Jack Rodrigue
- Wai Yuen (Wylliam) Zheng

This team will introduce Bayesian and discriminant analysis, comparing Naive Bayes (nb) and linear discriminant analysis (lda) comparing their strenghts, weaknesses and key differences.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Noble and group discussion (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Nobel will present their comparison of Bayesian and discriminant analysis.

2. **Hands-on predictive modeling using PANDORA (4:00 PM - 5:15 PM) ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š**  
   Use the provided dataset from PITCH study to predict N_IgG_responders (indiduals with partcularly high SARS-COV-2 antibodies recignizing N protecin 6 months after infection) using naive bayes and lda; and multiple other Bayesian and Discriminant analysis algorithms. Compare the efficiency between slecetd algorithms.
