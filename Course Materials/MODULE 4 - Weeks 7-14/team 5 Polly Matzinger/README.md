# Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods ðŸŒ³ðŸ”€
**Team 5 - Polly Matzinger**

### Members:
- Selena Halabi
- Kewei Ye
- Jordan Smiley
- Lexi Wittstadt (and their pets ðŸ˜‰)

This team will introduce decision tree and ensemble methods, focusing on the algorithms **C5.0** and **Random Forest (RF)**. They will highlight each algorithm's strengths, weaknesses, and key differences, especially in the context of predicting immunological responses.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **Presentation by Team Matzinger and Group Discussion (Until 4:00 PM) ðŸŽ¤**
   - Team Matzinger will introduce decision tree algorithms and ensemble methods, emphasizing C5.0 and Random Forest.

2. **Hands-on Predictive Modeling using PANDORA (4:00 PM - 5:15 PM) ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š**
   - In this session, you will apply decision tree and ensemble methods to predict immune response outcomes using the COVID-19 dataset.
   - **Goal**: Predict which individuals are likely to have high antibody levels six months after infection based on their immunological measurements taken 28 days post-infection.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following variables:

- **Sex**: Biological sex of the participant
- **PseudoNA_Abs, ADCD, ADMP, ADNKA, ADNP**: Pseudo-neutralizing antibodies and antibody immune cell functions
- **S_IgA, S_IgG1, S_IgG2, S_IgG3, S_IgG4, S_IgM, S_IgA_memB_SARS_CoV2**: Various spike-specific antibodies
- **MemB_229E, MemB_HKU1, MemB_NL63, MemB_OC43**: Memory B cell responses for different seasonal coronaviruses
- **SARS-CoV-2 Measures**: Includes variables like SARS-CoV-2 N_MSD, RBD_MSD, and S_MSD
- **Proliferation markers**: Proliferation rates for various immune cell types
- **ELISpot markers**: T cell responses measured by ELISpot
- **Outcome Variable**: **N_IgG_responder** â€“ Indicates if the individual is a high responder (high anti-N SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 6 months post-infection)

This data is derived from the study *Divergent trajectories of antiviral memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection* (Nature Communications, 2022). We are using day 28 post-infection measurements to predict long-term immunity responses.

## ML Analysis Parameters

- **Outcome**: **N_IgG_responder**
   - The target variable predicting if an individual will have high antibody levels 6 months post-infection.
   
- **Predictors**: All measurements except sex
   - These immunological measurements serve as the predictors in the model.

- **Training Set**: 75% of the data (n=56)
   - Used to train the model and help it learn patterns.

- **Test Set**: 25% of the data (n=18)
   - Used to assess the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.

## Preprocessing

1. **Centering and Scaling**:
   - Standardizes data so all features contribute equally to the model training.

   **Example Calculation**:
   - Original Data: `[15, 25, 35]`
   - Mean: `25`
   - SD: `8.16`
   - Centered/Scaled Data: `[-1.22, 0, 1.22]`

2. **Median Imputation**:
   - Replaces missing values with the column median, which is less influenced by outliers.

   **Example Calculation**:
   - Original Data (with NaN): `[10, NaN, 30, 20]`
   - Imputed Data: `[10, 20, 30, 20]`

3. **Correlation and Zero/Near Zero Variance Filtering**:
   - Removes features with high correlation and low variance.

   **Example**:
   - Feature 1 and Feature 2 are highly correlated.
   - Feature 3 has near-zero variance; both would be removed.

## Team Tasks

- **Comparison of RF and C5.0**: Which algorithm achieves the highest AUC for predicting immune responders?
- **Feature Importance**: Identify key predictors of a high antibody response at 6 months.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluate the effectiveness of both RF and C5.0 in predicting high responders.
