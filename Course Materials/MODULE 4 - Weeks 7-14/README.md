# MODULE 4: From Theory to Practice: AI in Immunological Cases 🤖🧬

## Overview 📚
Module 4 is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application of machine learning (ML) techniques in immunology. Throughout the module, students will engage in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, applying these to immunological datasets using the [PANDORA software](https://github.com/genular/pandora). Teams will present theoretical aspects of assigned algorithms before performing hands-on analyses.
