# MODULE 4: From Theory to Practice: AI in Immunological Cases ü§ñüß¨

## Overview üìö
Module 4 is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application of machine learning (ML) techniques in immunology. Students will work with real-world datasets to explore how AI-driven approaches can predict immune responses and immunological memory, focusing on the systems biology of vaccination and disease immunity. 

Throughout the module, students will engage in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, applying these to immunological datasets using the [PANDORA software](https://github.com/genular/pandora) and insights from the [PITCH study](https://www.pitch-study.org/). Teams will present theoretical aspects of assigned algorithms before performing hands-on analyses. By the end of the module, students will have a deeper understanding of how machine learning can be used to predict immune outcomes and aid in vaccine development.

The module is divided into two phases:
1. **Supervised Learning Approaches**: Teams will first explore algorithms where the model learns from labeled data to make predictions (Bayesian models, decision trees, ensemble methods, neural networks).
2. **Unsupervised Learning Approaches**: Teams will then explore algorithms where the model discovers hidden patterns or groupings in the data without labeled outcomes (dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering methods).

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Understand the theory and application of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques in the context of immunology.
- Use machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret immunological datasets, gaining insights into immune responses and memory.
- Apply tools such as [PANDORA](https://github.com/genular/pandora) to real-world datasets, demonstrating the predictive power of machine learning in immunological research.

### Structure of the Module:
- **Phase 1: Supervised Learning** (Weeks 7-10)
  - Introduce and apply supervised machine learning techniques such as Bayesian methods, decision trees, ensemble methods, and neural networks.
  - Teams will present the theoretical foundations of these algorithms followed by class hands-on analysis using the PANDORA platform.

- **Phase 2: Unsupervised Learning** (Weeks 11-14)
  - Introduce and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, including dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, MCA, tSNE, UMAP) and clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN).
  - Teams will explore how these algorithms reveal hidden patterns in immunological datasets, then we will apply them in the class using PANDORA.
