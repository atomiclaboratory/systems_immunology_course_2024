# MODULE 4: From Theory to Practice: AI in Immunological Cases 🤖🧬
## Overview 📚
In this module, we will transition from theoretical knowledge to hands-on application of AI and machine learning (ML) techniques in immunology. Using the [PITCH study](https://www.pitch-study.org/), students will explore how AI can be used to predict immunological memory to emerging viruses. Each group will be assigned specific tasks involving different machine learning approaches, and they will work collaboratively to analyze the data, interpret the results, and present their findings.
