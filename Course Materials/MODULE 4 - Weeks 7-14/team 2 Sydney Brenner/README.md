Today, Team Brenner will present dimensionality reduction techniques, focusing on **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** as a powerful tool to simplify complex immunological datasets. PCA reduces dataset complexity while preserving essential information, enabling us to identify key patterns that reveal relationships and variations in immune responses.

## ðŸ§© Concepts to Understand

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ðŸ“‰
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a smaller set of uncorrelated components, called **principal components**. These components represent the directions in which data variation is highest, making it easier to interpret complex datasets by focusing on a few main axes of variation.

#### Key Features of PCA:
- **Principal Components**: New variables created from original data that capture the highest variance in the dataset.
- **Variance Explanation**: Each principal component explains a portion of the total dataset variance, allowing for the selection of components that retain meaningful information.
- **Interpretation**: Enables identification of patterns, relationships, and trends that may not be obvious in raw data.
- **Comparison with Clustering**: While PCA reduces dimensions based on variance, clustering groups data based on similarity, as seen in Team Margulisâ€™s presentation.

## PCA Analysis in PANDORA
1. **Select Parameters**: Use immunological data such as antibody and T-cell responses measured across different days.
2. **Pre-processing Steps**: Normalize and scale the data (center/scale) to ensure that each variable contributes equally; and impute missing values with MedianImpute.
3. **Run PCA**: Execute PCA in PANDORA to extract the top principal components that explain the highest variance.
4. **Interpret Results**: Analyze the loadings of each variable on the principal components to understand which immune responses are most influential in driving variation in the data.
5. **Visualize**: Create plots to visualize clusters of data points along the principal components, helping to identify natural groupings or trends in immune responses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Team Task

### TASK: Analyzing and Interpreting PCA Results ðŸ”„
- **Objective**: Use PCA to uncover key patterns in the dataset, interpreting the meaning of each principal component and how it relates to immune response.
- **Goal**: Identify the principal components that capture the most significant variance, interpret the main factors driving these components, and reflect on the advantages of using PCA to analyze immunological data.
