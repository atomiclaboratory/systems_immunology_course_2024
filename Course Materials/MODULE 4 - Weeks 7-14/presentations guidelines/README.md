# Module 4 Presentation Guidelines 📊🧠

Each team will focus on **key algorithms** and deliver a **20-minute presentation**. Your task is to clearly explain how these algorithms work, their strengths, weaknesses, and key differences. Make the presentation **engaging and visually appealing** by using **videos, animations, and visual aids**.

## General Guidelines:
- **Focus on key algorithms** assigned to your team.
- Keep the presentation **within 20 minutes**.
- Use **videos**, **animations**, and **visual aids** to enhance clarity.
